# Mesa examples

Sample projects using the mesa python library.

- [Forest Fire](./forestFire/): Implements a simulation of fire that is spreading through a forest. Based on the example found on the mesa github.
- [Random Agents](./randomAgents/): Simulation of agents moving in random directions.
- [Traffic Base](./trafficBase/): Base simulation for the traffic simulation. Contains city maps that are used to create a model for the agents to interact with.

To run the examples, change into the correct directory, and run the command:
```bash
solara run server.py
```
